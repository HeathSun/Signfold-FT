## Component Analysis

### RotatingGradientRight Component
- **Props**: None (self-contained)
- **State**: None (static component)
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Card and CardContent from shadcn/ui
  - Button from shadcn/ui
  - ArrowRight icon from lucide-react

### Responsive Behavior
- Mobile-first design
- Grid layout switches from 1 column to 2 columns on medium screens
- Text scales appropriately across breakpoints
- Card maintains fixed width but container is responsive

### Animation Details
- Conic gradient rotates continuously (8s linear infinite)
- Uses CSS custom properties for color theming
- Blur effect creates glow around the card
- Backdrop blur on the card itself

## Usage
The component is now available at `http://localhost:3000` and displays the rotating gradient effect with a progress card and descriptive text.

## Next Steps
- The component is ready for production use
- Can be easily customized by modifying the gradient colors, animation speed, or content
- Consider adding props for customization if needed in the future
